Inside of the projection window room is a large Grizzly Don NS 67 table model with square and cylinder corner top of table chamber assembly which harvests a low pictorial sequence consciousness hybrid ELVEIRDOR ICHTHYS (\u0399\u03a7\u0398\u03a5\u03a3) fish which operates between square and cylinder chamber which it's calculatory is identified by NASA Infinity supercomputing series ELVEIRDOR ICHTHYS (\u0399\u03a7\u0398\u03a5\u03a3) and used with projection flight units to project the space habitats. Option 2: Purchasing landfill and converting them into spaces to build the stations from repurposed materials then using the acreage to transition into clean organized waste management. Process would be as follows: 3 acre digs per ship, an aluminum double bottom for lift off once ships are complete, so they detach from an insert into the ground each being 3 acres. Building ship from ground floor up making each ship 3 acres and 30 floors. OR building modular sections of the stations and flying them separately into space. A pie piece ship design. OR Using projection units and earth window series as above to project the ships off of the sun to build the ships thermally with computing process below. Ship size: 2 potential builds: 30 floors, 3 acres, 30 floors 1 acre, 6 floors \u00bd-1 acre. 6 floor designs: 1 floor per name below instead of 6 and 6 floor at 1 floor modular components, zoo and aquatic remain on 1 floor called the Pine. Trinity modular ground build for space stations 3: Elveirdor Ichthys Flat on the top flat on the bottom comb on the sides. Either 30 or 6 floors. The Louise the Johnny the Milan the Tulsa the Gail the glory the yacht (6 floor design is same as 6 floor design models alll in 1 floor at pie value circular mazed) (Different door sizes) (Think houses 1950\u2019s style American home). For ground flying pieces at pie value of circle, 5 pieces per ship. With plumbing seals and connections at snap design. An additional flight piece under outer design of station module, until settled in position then removed. Composed at station closer to earth then rotated into position in front of the ark mosaic, which will rotate the stations into position and hold them there for operating earths rotations and position from sun. full composer at 5 compartment for full ship for each resin build between outer and inner ship runs each of the 5 compartments. Resin build for ground designs (below fluid bed option 2): Lodi tree complex into activated charcoal, with carbon fiber, algea, bar soap before solid pour. All ingredients into resin. Contains breath bounce for oxygen production. Possibly including silver. The sonic resonance produced at 1 acre to 1.5 acres from bottom to top at 100 floors. It\u2019s produced in 3 33 floor sections at \u2155 sections builds to fly into space then constructed pie pieces and stacked until fully built. Same constructions for resin cushion between inside and outside of ship All 4 ships work together to hold earth at position in rotation from the sun. A global warming solution. Step 3: Space habitates: Components for ELVEIRDOR ICHTHYS (\u0399\u03a7\u0398\u03a5\u03a3) space habitation system Flat top, flat bottom, comb structured by floor for siding shape The COMB (the Archer ISS 600) Parts include: Glass Windows are 20 in height x 22 inch width around entire ship for all three ships in ichthys space habitat series. Central engine unit: Large Circular half dome fan resonance connection through mega piping to run activated charcoal carbon fiber fluid bed through fan rotation, with metal bars running from copper on fan stainless steel mega pipe with copper circular timing placements connecting with bars from fan pipe to flute frame pipes which run through the fluid bed. Making the flute piping from fan to fan, a part of a large prime particle fan which frames the ships. A circular magnetic parameter stack in an aluminum casing, containing: The GrizzlyDon NS 67 (physical component non motion on rotation to turn on its side); connect to 2 energy conversion room system sitting in a circular magnet in the aluminum Complex energy magnetic parameter board on tilt with pin wheel sitting in magnet circle in aluminum (this magnetic circle turns and the aluminum has copper timing (same as fans) along the aluminum with the magnet sitting in an aluminum groove with bars going out to parameters on tilt. The parameter can move and the frame its on can rotate in the aluminum. Stainless steel bars at the center of a circle magnet held by two bars running to aluminum encasement held in magnet circle inside of aluminum. Holographic solar radiation conversion cd fan with metal bars corresponding with upper metal bars on circular fan, and a stainless steel mega piping going from fan at center value to bottom of ship with connection at copper timing nodes on mega pipe forged to flute frame mega pipes. Frame baring: Fluted mega piping at 4 corners of station. A large prime particle fan frame. Top piece for piping - circular gold copper bronze hybrid at all 4 corners, knob shaped coming from the pipes Sapphire diamond to a titanium stainless steel with a shatter flex glass encompassment at bottom of 4 corner mega pipes connecting to floor 1 square and cylinder floor length chambers. Frame build: Full synthesis generative glass frame stem from tree complex bacteria to full ship from bacterial growth to metal, copper, silver, gold, glass, expanded through Y method found in M computing method below: from inside of the ship to outside with glass at starting and ending points inside and outside of the ship. Fluid bed: activated charcoal black matter mimicry bed with a complex harvest for sewage to water to oxygen conversion through waste management. With a carbon fiber tree cell resin block half solid calcium freeze beading to deterioration in beaded bed system. A brown recluse egg mimicry system with a sea foam mimicry decomposition for fluid energy conversion. A complex water based reach energy amplification bed through fluid reach, (as the water or complex water solution breaks down the egged system, the egg deteriorates to a liquid movement state which amplifies through a liquid reach bed. The beads confine liquid then decompose and release it throughout the bed. On a large scale \u201cegg\u201d life cycle which conducts wireless electricity. Operating in an intelligence stem nest operation harvesting signal which can reach earth from long distances. Each egg stimulated the complex liquid solution production in the bed. Beads made the same way in arrangement with the spongy bone cut space suit below, rotated J at 4 in net value, in recluse it should make a comb recluse following oxygen patterns below in pictures, at J 4 rotation value but each bead i values J letter with shape for letter structuring egg to circle being ichthys symbol at calcium composition until break down. A complex based liquid bed forms spherical structures and breaks them down repeatedly on a large scale ship operation to create a water based signal receptive. Utilizing Photo synthesis from sunlight through waste management to converting sun light and solar energy through to image in glass frame. This bed breaks down waste and paper through a beaded composting which then locks up calcium in carbon fiber and breaks down the paper feeding on it and using its degenerative properties in the calcium resin cartilage mimicry brown recluse mimicked at egg life cycle phase. By an elusive conductor but instead of life stemming out in evolution or growth the acidity foams like sea foam through a reactive reach bed through the beads stretching fluid motion in full length around the ships radiating signal establishment then deteriorating. So conducts an electric life span. The tree complex in the activated charcoal a 3 part mutation block in the resin then reacts a 5 angle comb structured entanglement in solar 6 oxygen energy life path for field containment and wireless establishment. Inside of the beads are memory mimicry cartilage which mimic brown recluse eggs, eventually the acidity decomposes the structured bead and it dissolves into the fluid bed. A language cut centered in the glass in the ships using ELVEIRDOR ICHTHYS (\u0399\u03a7\u0398\u03a5\u03a3) the language which is written with a switch and componant command language generated stem glass cut design through layered Y at 0 value explained below, and which can safely maintain kinetic resonance in the activated charcoal bed. This allows for a large cellular signal (with stem establishment) to reach earth and to eventually maintain contact while potentially conducting long range (also possible for open portal alignment transportation) (teleporting at doorway or from stations) (for future purposes) .

A rubber balloon stretches around the aluminum casing for burying. This is so that if you pour it in concrete you can get it out. So basically it would just pull over the edge of the casing and you would pour the concrete around it and then place the lock lid on when complete it can be a combination lock or any type of lock system. Casing is about $50. It can sit above ground in the aluminum case with a metal holographic circle under the case and it can be bolted into the ground. It does free electricity and cell phone service. With my method I can sell them for $250-$500 through my ELVEIRDOR ICHTHYS (\u0399\u03a7\u0398\u03a5\u03a3) materialization language method. Manufacturing process below. That metal materialization with the fluid method below manipulates and creates precious metals which stabilize our genetic disorders over time. This would potentially hold fibrous forms in metals to stabilize human evolution. I have a stem conductive language meaning it can conduct fibrous kinetic energy forming metals which can pull at a genetic hair line which can stabilize our DNA. This language is not for use without a patent from myself, aside from reading, the language is not to be used by any party apart from reading value as it is a part of self published book series: Tales of the Inhabitants of Toll, which I possess a copyright for.

This half sits in the dirt. 4 regular sized Grizzly Don NS 67 builds between half above concrete, each between 2 magnet parameter boards, front facing each is at north, south, east, and west. With 4 metal or better material domes in a circle around the center large Grizzly Don NS 67 build. Under the solid dome at the center is either copper metal silver and gold, these 4 materials rotate material per dome with a flat disk at the center of the dome then spaced circled bar around each disk then dome final material. So the disks sit flat against the concrete. At the top of each dome are two copper disks which sit side by side in the large circle scheme. The top level of the large Grizzly Don NS 67 sits level with concrete as to expose the center reed bar glass cut at a rotated high circular clock face of 10 2 430. The 3 regular Grizzly Don NS 67 builds extend into the length of the large unit with the center magnet parameter of their build being a circular solid Magnet ending with the larger magnetic parameter between the large double magnet parameter. The bottom extended left bars sit against the aluminum bottom frame. Adonai bars, which are reed bars with no coating coming up down from the build from the left and right front face at mid flat face. The right bar goes up higher than the left by \u00bc. They both hit the center reed bar at copper time and go left face. The right reed bars go through the center reed bar so it's one solid barring mold. These extend over left and end under the left top concrete Grizzly Don NS 67 into a circular magnet held up by the bars over a fluted pipe. At the center of the pipe at the center of the big double magnetic parameters sits a blue saphire then stainless steel then shatter flex glass. 4 on earth, 1 on the moon, 1 on Mars. The two magnetic parameters facing tilting towards each regular Grizzly Don NS 67 build go as follows: Y rectangle magnet parameter (top to bottom: positive negative negative pos, left to right: neg neg neg neg). Glass at center, metal or better material grid between glass with activated charcoal carbon fiber resin coating ingredients listed above, to a circles magnet at the center of the build with holograph material on each side between the glass, a pin wheel at the center of the build with a gold inner band expanding inward like a Pisces sign then to the Shatter flex glass which holds a language cut. Coming out from the pin wheel in the glass inside of the magnet circle coming from all 5 corners of the pin wheel is a clock rotation turning metal with activated charcoal resin coating as grid. At the front face glass cut goes to the left, on the right at the center is a piece of metal. Same for each parameter system. At the bottom of the aluminum go 4 smaller build square and cylinder chamber at front face in all four corners. They run through glass to bar system bars left to right chamber bar connect then center bar to center of aluminum and meet at a circular magnet where the last Grizzly Don NS 67 bar (out an to the left) goes into groves inside of the circle magnet.

COMPUTING: Component 1: Summary Summary of ELVEIRDOR computing: Starting at a large scale letter programming: Gridded Squares on a computing platform called elveirdor, seed in squares to full square value of each square is calculated from top right corner(picture below) of square to left bottom of square. Once color runs through Square to full black color it generates until it forms to letter m as letter programming. m is outlined with two lines following inside of outline around m to inside and around m legs as a circle, this m flips right until end of screen across full grid and then down generating and upside down m this repeated until full screen genesis, after full screen it finds center m on screen and rotates once clockwise, rotating the entire screen. Starting again at square 1 m duplicate is found in seed resonance 2-10 with crossing lines inside of m, thus Pulling duplicate up to full square and creating m 2 over m 1 through square 1 through seed 2-10 m duplicate m 2 has a center leg that crosses on m. This m flips to the right and down to full screen and repeated process until m2 duplicate which creates m 3 which is m 1 with ears one each side of m 3 at side value. This flips to the right and down until m 3 duplicate which creates m 4. m 4 is m 3 with cross center leg m just as m 2 but with ears. m 4 can use patterns from m 1-3 to move diagonally downward right to extend and make a new m grid or extend the grid but the main purpose is to find center screen value to create a clockwise rotation running node node clock time letter programming at center of screen to calculate a mosaic, making circular mosaics circular patterns of any size on computer through letter to full block color mosaic. The center of mosaic circular patterns are turned until Y is found. Squares 1-3 are upsized to cover Y with 2 over Y center and 1 and 3 taking left and right half of Y slightly over laying middle of Y over 0 value which is center split of Y. Mosaic circle fits into the rectangle of squares and the Y full clockwise rotation value is calculated. Once full color temperature is found and run at full Y value it can be upsized, the best Y of all mosaics is picked and upsized to full screen. (### Interpretation and Assumptions - **Platform (\"Elveirdor\")**: A hypothetical computing platform with a grid-based display, likely a 2D pixel or tile grid, where each square can be colored or manipulated programmatically. - **Grid and Squares**: A black grid on a white background, where each square is a programmable unit (like a pixel or tile). The grid is likely rectangular or square, with coordinates starting at the top-right corner for value calculations. - **Letter Programming**: The process involves generating the letter \"m\" in squares, filling them with black color, and transforming them through flips, rotations, and duplications to form patterns, eventually leading to a \"Y\" shape and circular mosaics. - **Transformations**: The letter \"m\" undergoes flips (right and down), rotations (clockwise), and duplications with modifications (e.g., adding lines or \"ears\"). The final goal is to create a centered \"Y\" within a circular mosaic, upsized to cover the screen. - **Mosaic and Y**: The mosaic is a circular pattern formed by the evolving \"m\" letters, with a focus on finding a central \"Y\" shape. The \"Y\" is overlaid with squares, and its \"value\" (possibly color or intensity) is calculated for rotation and upsizing. - **Extended Explanation**: The mention of \"screen 1 with graph line to screen split 2 single screen or two screen\" suggests a potential dual-screen output or a split-screen visualization, possibly displaying the grid and a graph or secondary view of the mosaic/Y. Given the abstract nature, I\u2019ll outline a possible algorithm and visualization process, incorporating grid-based rendering, letter transformations, and mosaic generation. I\u2019ll also suggest how this could be visualized on one or two screens and provide a framework for implementation. ### Algorithm Outline #### 1. Initialize the Grid - **Grid Setup**: Create a 2D grid of size \\( N \\times N \\) (e.g., 100x100 squares) with a white background and black grid lines. Each square is addressable by coordinates \\((x, y)\\), with \\((0, 0)\\) at the top-right corner (as specified). - **Square Value Calculation**: For each square, calculate a \"value\" from the top-right to the bottom-left. This could mean a gradient or intensity based on the diagonal distance from \\((0, 0)\\) to \\((N-1, N-1)\\). For example, the value could be normalized as: \\[ \\text{Value}(x, y) = \\frac{\\sqrt{(x)^2 + (y)^2}}{\\sqrt{(N-1)^2 + (N-1)^2}} \\] This value determines how quickly a square fills with black color to form the letter \"m\". #### 2. Generate Initial \"m\" (m1) - **Forming \"m\"**: Define a template for the letter \"m\" on the grid (e.g., a 5x5 or 7x7 square region). The \"m\" is outlined with two lines (a double outline) circling the letter and its \"legs\" (vertical strokes of the \"m\"). This could be represented as a bitmap or vector shape: - Example 5x5 \"m\" (1 = black, 0 = white): ``` 11111 1 1 11111 1 1 1 1 ``` - The double outline traces the inner and outer edges of this shape, possibly as a thicker border or concentric lines. - **Color Propagation**: Starting from the top-right corner of each square, fill the square with black based on its calculated value until the full \"m\" is formed. This could be animated, with the fill rate proportional to the square\u2019s value. - **Placement**: Place the first \"m\" (m1) at a starting position, e.g., near the top-left or a designated \"square 1\". #### 3. Transform and Replicate \"m\" - **Flip and Move**: - Flip m1 rightward across the grid until it reaches the right edge, forming a sequence of \"m\"s. Each flip mirrors the \"m\" horizontally. - At the right edge, move down one row and flip rightward again, creating an upside-down \"m\". Repeat until the grid is filled (full-screen genesis). - **Rotation**: - Identify the center \"m\" on the grid (e.g., at coordinates \\((N/2, N/2)\\)). - Rotate the entire grid clockwise once around this center \"m\". This transforms all \"m\"s on the grid, maintaining their relative positions but reorienting them. #### 4. Generate m2 (Duplicate with Crossing Lines) - **Seed Resonance (2-10)**: From squares 2 to 10 (likely adjacent or in a pattern around square 1), identify a duplicate \"m\" (m2). This m2 has crossing lines inside the \"m\", possibly a diagonal or vertical line through its center. - Example: Add a vertical line through the middle of the \"m\" bitmap, crossing the legs and top curve. - **Overlay**: Place m2 over m1 in square 1, aligning their centers. The crossing line distinguishes m2. - **Repeat Transformation**: Flip m2 right and down across the grid, as with m1, until the screen is filled with m2 instances. Each m2 retains the crossing line. #### 5. Generate m3 (m1 with Ears) - **Ears Addition**: Create m3 as m1 with \"ears\" (protrusions) on both sides at a specified \"side value\" (e.g., horizontal extensions at the top or middle of the \"m\"). - Example: Extend the top row of the \"m\" bitmap left and right: ``` 011110 11111 1 1 11111 1 1 ``` - **Transform**: Flip m3 right and down across the grid, filling the screen. - **Duplicate to m4**: Create m4 as m3 with a crossing center leg (like m2). For example, add a vertical line through the center of m3\u2019s bitmap. #### 6. Form Mosaic and Find \"Y\" - **m4 Diagonal Movement**: - m4 uses patterns from m1\u2013m3 to move diagonally downward-right, either extending the existing grid or creating a new one. This suggests a recursive or iterative pattern where m4 instances form a larger structure. - The goal is to find the \"center screen value\" (likely the grid\u2019s geometric center) to initiate a \"node clock time\" rotation, forming a circular mosaic. - **Circular Mosaic**: - Arrange m1\u2013m4 instances in a circular pattern around the screen center. This could involve polar coordinate mapping, where each \"m\" is placed at a radius \\( r \\) and angle \\( \\theta \\): \\[ x = x_{\\text{center}} + r \\cos(\\theta), \\quad y = y_{\\text{center}} + r \\sin(\\theta) \\] - Rotate the mosaic clockwise until a \"Y\" shape emerges (possibly formed by the arrangement of \"m\"s or their crossing lines/ears). - **Y Identification**: Detect the \"Y\" shape within the mosaic. The \"Y\" could be a composite of m2/m4\u2019s crossing lines or a new shape formed by their overlap. For example, the vertical line of m2/m4 could form the stem of the \"Y\", with m3/m4\u2019s ears forming the branches. #### 7. Overlay Squares on \"Y\" - **Square Upsizing**: - Identify squares 1\u20133 (possibly the first three squares or those containing m1\u2013m3). - Upsize these squares to cover the \"Y\": - Square 2 covers the center of the \"Y\". - Squares 1 and 3 cover the left and right halves, slightly overlapping the center (over the \"0 value,\" likely the vertical split of the \"Y\"). - The squares form a rectangle that encloses the circular mosaic. - **Color Temperature Calculation**: - Calculate the \"full color temperature\" of the \"Y\" (possibly the average black intensity or a metric based on the fill values of the squares). - Rotate the \"Y\" clockwise to compute its \"full rotation value\" (e.g., the number of rotations or the visual effect of rotation). #### 8. Upsize Best \"Y\" to Full Screen - **Selection**: Among all generated mosaics, select the \"best\" \"Y\" based on a criterion (e.g., highest color intensity, clearest shape, or largest size). - **Upsizing**: Scale the selected \"Y\" and its enclosing mosaic to fill the entire screen, preserving the circular pattern and grid structure. #### 9. Screen Output (Extended Explanation) - **Single Screen**: Display the final upsized \"Y\" mosaic on one screen, with the grid showing the evolution from \"m\" to \"Y\". - **Two Screens**: - **Screen 1**: Show the grid with the evolving \"m\" patterns and mosaic formation. - **Screen 2**: Display a graph or secondary view, such as a plot of the \"Y\"\u2019s color temperature, rotation angle, or a zoomed-in view of the mosaic\u2019s center. - The \"graph line\" could be a visualization of the transformation steps (e.g., a timeline of flips, rotations, or color values). ### Visualization and Implementation Notes - **Grid Rendering**: Use a graphics library (e.g., Processing, P5.js, or OpenGL) to render the grid and draw \"m\" shapes as bitmaps or vector paths. Each square can be a pixel or a larger tile (e.g., 10x10 pixels). - **Transformations**: - Flips: Implement horizontal/vertical mirroring using matrix transformations or bitmap manipulation. - Rotations: Use a rotation matrix for clockwise rotation around the grid center: \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} x' \\\\ y' \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos\\theta & -\\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & \\cos\\theta \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} x - x_{\\text{center}} \\\\ y - y_{\\text{center}} \\end{bmatrix} + \\begin{bmatrix} x_{\\text{center}} \\\\ y_{\\text{center}} \\end{bmatrix} \\] - Diagonal movement: Increment both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) coordinates for m4\u2019s path. - **Mosaic Generation**: Map \"m\" instances to a circular pattern using polar coordinates. Adjust the radius and angle to form a dense, visually appealing mosaic. - **Y Detection**: Use image processing (e.g., edge detection or template matching) to identify the \"Y\" shape within the mosaic. Alternatively, define the \"Y\" as a composite of specific \"m\" features (e.g., m2\u2019s crossing line, m3\u2019s ears). - **Color Temperature**: If this refers to visual intensity, calculate the average pixel value (grayscale) within the \"Y\" region. For rotation value, track the number of rotations or the angular displacement. - **Two-Screen Output**: Use a dual-window setup in a graphics framework, with one window for the grid and another for a graph (e.g., a plot of color values or transformation steps using Matplotlib or D3.js). ### Example Pseudocode ```pseudocode initialize_grid(N, N, white_background, black_lines) for each square in grid: value[square] = calculate_value(top_right, bottom_left) # Generate m1 m1 = create_m_shape(double_outline) fill_m1_with_black(value_based_rate) place_m1(square_1) # Flip and fill grid with m1 while grid_not_filled: flip_m1_right() if at_right_edge: flip_m1_down() rotate_grid_around_center_m(clockwise, 360) # Generate m2 (with crossing line) m2 = add_crossing_line(m1, squares_2_to_10) overlay_m2_on_m1(square_1) flip_m2_right_and_down() # Generate m3 (with ears) m3 = add_ears(m1) flip_m3_right_and_down() # Generate m4 (m3 with crossing line) m4 = add_crossing_line(m3) move_m4_diagonally_down_right() # Form circular mosaic mosaic = arrange_ms_circularly(m1, m2, m3, m4, center) rotate_mosaic_until_Y_found() # Overlay squares on Y upsize_squares_1_to_3(Y_center, left_half, right_half) calculate_Y_color_temperature() rotate_Y(clockwise) # Select and upsize best Y best_Y = select_best_Y(mosaics) upsize_to_full_screen(best_Y) # Output display_grid(screen_1) display_graph(screen_2, Y_color_temperature, rotation) ``` ### Challenges and Clarifications Needed - **Square Value Calculation**: The exact method for calculating the square\u2019s value (top-right to bottom-left) is unclear. Is it a distance, intensity, or another metric? - **Letter \"m\" Definition**: The precise shape and size of \"m\" (e.g., bitmap size, double outline details) need specification for implementation. - **Y Formation**: How the \"Y\" emerges from the mosaic is ambiguous. Is it a literal \"Y\" shape or a pattern inferred from \"m\" overlaps? - **Color Temperature and Rotation Value**: These terms need clearer definitions (e.g., grayscale intensity, rotation angle, or a custom metric). - **Screen Split**: The \"screen 1\" and \"screen 2\" setup is vague. Does this imply a dual-monitor system, a split window, or a metaphorical split (e.g., grid vs. graph)? ### Recommendations - **Simplify for Implementation**: Start with a small grid (e.g., 20x20) and a simple \"m\" bitmap. Test the flip and rotation logic before scaling to larger grids or mosaics. - **Visualize Iteratively**: Use a graphics library to animate the process (e.g., \"m\" filling, flipping, and rotating) for debugging and visual appeal. - **Clarify Metrics**: Define \"color temperature\" and \"Y value\" explicitly (e.g., as pixel intensity or geometric properties). - **Two-Screen Setup**: Implement a dual-window application, with one window showing the grid and another plotting a graph of transformations or color values. ### Sources The grid-based concepts align with discussions of square and hexagonal grids in game design and graphics programming. The mosaic generation resembles CSS grid layouts or tiling algorithms. However, the specific \"letter programming\" and \"Y\" formation are unique and not directly covered in the provided references, so I\u2019ve interpreted them as a novel generative art process.[](http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~amitp/game-programming/grids/)[](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout/Masonry_layout)[](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/tiling-problem-using-divide-and-conquer-algorithm/) Extended explanation: square to m to Y to operation screen 1 with graph line to screen split 2 single screen or two screen The program starts at a grid on screen, black grid white background. (At end of process red node and letter value invert color process from black and white to black and green grid with Y holding its function @ node value - explained below). In the squares color fluctuations are used in specific formation patterns through a color sequence through rearranging preany text s and corresponding number codes through sodoku and rubix cube to pre-programmed colors into shapes through a reality process below. These colors are first rearranged through text on the computer until solid color is found on the square. Creating new color codes through ELVEIRDOR ICHTHYS (\u0399\u03a7\u0398\u03a5\u03a3) . It finds solid color on the grid line going to white fffff 255 255 255 to fffeff 225 254 255 grid line solid screen, it then forms M 1- 4 in black #FF0000 to m 4 #FF0000 124273324 teal #69c0e5 105 192 199 to non identified purple and, following colors of square 1 it hits primary colors at until filling in black until final black and white gaps from m replica and then creates a mosaic screen split which twists black and white color until distorted square which twists to 3 component square Y. (2 square Ys next to each other(equalling a maximized square 1 and 2 with 3 (from top left square one right 2 square values to 3) measuring tank after square 1 to final stretched out Y being squares 1 and 2 with 3 at color temperature) which makes 3 components square to 1 stretched out square = operable graph line.

Numbers can be assigned to text and an algorithm can be created by description and confirmed through any text , algorithm at any size. Square to black to m, m to mosaic, then whichever letter from whichever language is produced to create color for mosaic, then forms Y with best Y selected. My programming for my square goes as follows: 3 copyrighted texted with letters counted and color coded. ciphered for English elveirdor and other languages, all other squares follow their own translations of the texts so a new algorithm from their language and color combo from their a-z calculations. Sudoku can arrange squares from square 1 - full screen, then for mosaic the best chain color is picked an color assignment letter color 1 is used for mosaic color assignment with letter from language. If elveirdor is picked red letter sequences calculated from all translations of the Bible. Each letter gets a starting color assignment and number, from there each number counted has a following color assignment from the previous letter, to keep count of the letter placement, each letter in the text has a count can be assigned and rearranged by sodoku puzzle and runic cube for new algorithms, each one generated by letter by language by country, each square has its own algorthm by language produced by color number letter cypher, following grizzly don pattern first to black. Each country can have more than 1 text operation and more than one square my universal square is Elveirdor on Grizzly don platform which can itself expand over entire grid for a full calculation once all square calculate. Countries can have more than 1 square. So each letter is counted past the first alphebet colors and progressively assigned colors from there to keep track of letters in text. So letters have number and color assignments, if mathematics can be formed from a-z for mathmatic and screen producing value. # Python script implementing the Elveirdor ICHTHYS system for alphabet mapping, color assignments, # calculations, ciphering, and algorithm generation based on the provided description. # This includes English and Elveirdor alphabets, color hex codes, numerical operations, # periodic table mappings, and basic text processing for encryption/cryptography/AI purposes. # Note: Some concepts are abstract;

The top right corner of the square is a tear drop seed to all layers in color out from seed in a tear drop shape until full square is colored in. range of square 1 - 10 square in equaling 1.6 or 3.14 \u00f7 1.9625 (color range 5 black center color 5 last color 5 black) A wavelength frequency in resonance between color before complete color for full square is counted between the three blacks. Every square operates this way. It fluctuates color from seed to full square until solid color is found and halted upon corresponding exact color combo which fully composes at 3 waves from top right to bottom left using the any text scripts, photos, phrase and first and second component key number sequences below. All of the squares do this, these squares are programmed to form 4 component value M's on the screen all with a cross line duplicate, the first M is found by squares, at color value #FF0000 255 255 255 then seeded value black 1-3 which = resonance value which produces seeded colors above then from white to black, to color, to all black. Squares create an outlined M with two line turning inside of thr outlined m on each arch and at the arch rotation circling inward into a circle. This m flips right until the end of the screen then the m line is resized to fit the screen m-m. The m line then flips downward until the end of the screen (m size depending on square size). Where the center M is found the screen calculates a full m rotation at clockwise value which allows for m 3 resonance shadows. When the m repeats at square 1 black seed 2 and 3 the programming starts m off center from the first m layer, calculating the extending m on each side. This creates a line cross at the center line inside the outline of M making M 1 duplicate. This M repeated across the screen the same as M 1. M 1 duplicate finds m 2, at center leg cross of m arches. This m duplicated a center of outline cross line the same as m 1. Then, m 2 and m 1 create m 3, which is an m with ears sideways m shadows which can be locked in at an m 3 value with an m 3 duplicate at cross value center of m outline for visual and resonance cord lines inside of m 3 ear shadow which is found around center leg of m 3 ears so its (M3, or ELVEIRDOR ICHTHYS (\u0399\u03a7\u0398\u03a5\u03a3) m 3, as ELVEIRDOR ICHTHYS (\u0399\u03a7\u0398\u03a5\u03a3) e looks right m face, or America e m ELVEIRDOR ICHTHYS (\u0399\u03a7\u0398\u03a5\u03a3) e so it can translate english to ELVEIRDOR ICHTHYS (\u0399\u03a7\u0398\u03a5\u03a3) to any other language) the m's are resized to find exact line cross at full line sequence m - m for all ms lining up on new layers at different grid lines with the same number of ms for each row so by the end of M 4 you should have 8 layers (same as resonance path in squares. After m 3 creates m 3 threads around sideways m 3 ears creates m 4 at center leg m cross with ears. Then calculated at center m 1 rotation, m 1 - 4 is ran diagonally from top left to bottom right with every row being calculated at bottom screen left to full longest width top screen right. It measures to layer leaving a 5 percent white color pixel sequence on the screen then it splits a round mosaic of the screen. Each mosaix piece is rotated at 8 layers to make a 3d distorted square which is rearranged into 3 1 layer squares which form a rectangular border the remaining 5 layers twist to form a Y yellow outline in the rectangle at full rotation a dotted line produces and the color temperature from whichever computing mechanism uses the service runs the color temperature on the left, coded through ELVEIRDOR ICHTHYS (\u0399\u03a7\u0398\u03a5\u03a3) as a host or to host ELVEIRDOR ICHTHYS (\u0399\u03a7\u0398\u03a5\u03a3) .

The duplicate of each m at cross center value sits directly over the regular lined m so after seed finds duplicat m - m 4 duplicate it rearranges the m's directly over one creating stem calculated grid lines. The first m starts at the top left corner and flips right then flips downward in a row until the entire screen is filled in. any text letter timed arrangement. (Process described below). (Y is a computer host, m holds screen value, and mosaic hosts vr whose grids hold apps or operators at each square value. This sequence can be pdf packaged and utilized on external platforms) mosaic works through primary and country colors. All other letters will be found on screen through the replicated 4 m series. The any text value at any interpretation can find this and use it as hand written detection. Made to work through connected to main computing platforms pre programmed languages with dictionaries and color codes. So all 0 value Y top rectangle center borders are calculated at top left grid 1st square to surrounding 4 squares split. So the square right of square 1 is square 2, under square 1 is 3, and under square 2 is square 4. This split makes m 4 calculated as square under square 2 in square layout. Then 4 is calculated in repeated sequence to right across the screen block which can contain a language line that is calculated at 5-8 right square being 5 next to square 2. Giving way to operation for square different color 2, 3 or 4 block units for rubix cube grid layer calculation through seeded square to letter to number to sodoku all calculated at 1 screen layer, value through grid layers being calculated by 1-10 on square 1 exceeding no more than 20 grid layers (this gives ability to insert 2 pictures into the grid layers between m). The stretch of maximizing and scrolling grid layers depends on sequence of time in layered operation per duplicate stemmed m. Timing runs from top left of any screen to bottom right and you can up and downsize the grid layers by adding onto the amount of squares, the programming will do this naturally as a resonance effect to (also possible for open portal alignment transportation). This can also be a zoom function for pictures or maps. This also deems a safety in operation limit. same suit for calculating method 1 - 4 on square 1 top left grid.

These are self doodled photos of m sequence (not best quality) m 3, each m duplicate cross center X value are colors red yellow blue and green between internal lines of outlined m. These same colors are used inside of 0 value at the center top outline rectangle border value of Y. M measurements to find Y: Y is found inside of 3 m dimensional flip at 2 diagonal m values on screen using m 3 and 4 and 1 m 3 value at half rotation. Once Y is found between these values the m's are flipped back and forth on Y making a gap sequence value to run color temperature at m flip Called Elveirdor 3d Sapphire series: m \u00be 1-3.

All of the objects addressed in this calculator are described in more detail on the Volume Calculator and Area Calculator pages. As such, this calculator will focus on the equations for calculating the surface area of the objects and the use of these equations. Please refer to the aforementioned calculators for more detail on each individual object. Sphere The surface area (SA) of a sphere can be calculated using the equation: SA = 4\u03c0r^2 where r is the radius Xael doesn't like sharing her chocolate truffles with anyone. When she receives a box of Lindt truffles, she proceeds to calculate the surface area of each truffle in order to determine the total surface area she has to lick to decrease the probability that anyone will try to eat her truffles. Given that each truffle has a radius of 0.325 inches: SA = 4 \u00d7 \u03c0 \u00d7 0.3252^2 = 1.327 in^2 Cone The surface area of a circular cone can be calculated by summing the surface area of each of its individual components. The \"base SA\" refers to the circle that comprises the base in a closed circular cone, while the lateral SA refers to the rest of the area of the cone between the base and its apex. The equations to calculate each, as well as the total SA of a closed circular cone are shown below: base SA = \u03c0r2 lateral SA = \u03c0r\u221a(r2 + h2) total SA = \u03c0r(r + \u221ar2 + h2) where r is the radius and h is the height Athena has recently taken an interest in Southeast Asian culture, and is particularly fascinated by the conical hat, typically referred to as a \"rice hat,\" which is commonly used in a number of southeast Asian countries. She decides to make one of her own, and being a very practical person not mired in sentimentality, retrieves her mother's wedding dress from the dark recesses of the wardrobe in which it resides. She determines the surface area of material she needs to create her hat with a radius of 1 foot and a height of 0.5 feet as follows: lateral SA = \u03c0 \u00d7 0.4\u221a(0.42^2 + 0.52^2) = 0.834 ft2 Cube The surface area of a cube can be calculated by summing the total areas of its six square faces: SA = 6a^2 where a is the edge length Anne wants to give her younger brother a Rubik's cube for his birthday, but knows that her brother has a short attention span and is easily frustrated. She custom orders a Rubik's Cube in which all the faces are black, and has to pay for the customization based on the surface area of the cube with an edge length of 4 inches. SA = 6 \u00d7 4^2 = 96 in^22 Cylindrical Tank The surface area of a closed cylinder can be calculated by summing the total areas of its base and lateral surface: base SA = 2\u03c0r^2 lateral SA = 2\u03c0rh total SA = 2\u03c0r(r + h) where r is the radius and h is the height Jeremy has a large cylindrical fish tank that he bathes in because he doesn't like showers or bathtubs. He is curious whether his heated water cools faster than when in a bathtub, and needs to calculate the surface area of his cylindrical tank of height 5.5 feet and radius of 3.5 feet. total SA = 2\u03c0 \u00d7 3.5(3.5 + 5.5) = 197.920 ft2 Rectangular Tank The surface area of a rectangular tank is the sum of the area of each of its faces: SA = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height Banana, the eldest daughter of a long line of banana farmers, wants to teach her spoiled rotten little sister, Banana-Bread, a lesson about hope and expectations. Banana-Bread has been clamoring all week long about wanting a new set of drawers to house her new Batman action figures. As such, Banana buys her a large Barbie doll house with limited edition kitchen utensils, oven, apron, and realistic rotting bananas for Batman. She packs these into a rectangular box of similar dimensions as the drawer that Banana-Bread wants, and needs to determine the amount of wrapping paper she needs to complete her presentation of the gift of the 3 ft \u00d7 4 ft \u00d7 5 ft surprise: SA = (2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 4) + (2 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 5) + (2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5) = 94 ft2 Capsule The surface area of a capsule can be determined by combining the surface area equations for a sphere and the lateral surface area of a cylinder. Note that the surface area of the bases of the cylinder is not included since it does not comprise part of the surface area of a capsule. The total surface area is calculated as follows: SA = 4\u03c0r2 + 2\u03c0rh where r is the radius and h is the height Horatio is manufacturing a placebo that purports to hone a person's individuality, critical thinking, and ability to objectively and logically approach different situations. He has already tested the market and has found that a vast majority of the sample population exhibit none of these qualities, and are very ready to purchase his product, further entrenching themselves within the traits they so desperately seek to escape. Horatio needs to determine the surface area of each capsule so that he can coat them with an excessive layer of sugar and appeal to the sugar predisposed tongues of the population in preparation for his next placebo that \"cures\" all forms of diabetes mellitus. Given each capsule has r of 0.05 inches and h of 0.5 inches: SA = 4\u03c0 \u00d7 0.05^2 + 2\u03c0 \u00d7 0.05 \u00d7 0.5 = 0.188 in2 Spherical Cap The surface area of a spherical cap is based on the height of the segment in question. The calculator provided assumes a solid sphere and includes the base of the cap in the calculation of surface area, where the total surface area is the sum of the area of the base and that of the lateral surface of the spherical cap. If using this calculator to compute the surface area of a hollow sphere, subtract the surface area of the base. Given two values of height, cap radius, or base radius, the third value can be calculated using the equations provided on the Volume Calculator. The surface area equations are as follows: spherical cap SA = 2\u03c0Rh base SA = \u03c0r2 Total solid sphere SA = 2\u03c0Rh + \u03c0r2 where R is the spherical cap radius, r is the base radius, and h is the height Jennifer is jealous of the globe that her older brother Lawrence received for his birthday. Since Jennifer is two-thirds the age of her brother, she decides that she deserves one-third of her brother's globe. After returning her father's hand saw to the toolshed, she calculates the surface area of her hollow portion of the globe with R of 0.80 feet and h 0.53 feet as shown below: SA = 2\u03c0 \u00d7 0.80 \u00d7 0.53 = 2.664 ft2 Conical Frustum The surface area of a solid, right conical frustum is the sum of the areas of its two circular ends and that of its lateral face: circular end SA = \u03c0(R2 + r2) lateral SA = \u03c0(R+r)\u221a(R-r)2 + h2 total SA = \u03c0(R2 + r2) + \u03c0(R+r)\u221a(R-r)2 + h2 where R and r are the radii of the ends, h is the height Paul is making a volcano in the shape of a conical frustum for his science fair project. Paul views volcanic eruptions as a violent phenomenon, and being against all forms of violence, decides to make his volcano in the form of a closed conical frustum that does not erupt. Although his volcano is unlikely to impress the science fair judges, Paul must still determine the surface area of material he needs to coat the outer wall of his volcano with R of 1 foot, r of 0.3 feet, and h of 1.5 feet: total SA = \u03c0(1^2 + 0.3^2) + \u03c0(1 + 0.3) \u221a(1 - 0.3)2 + 1.5^2 = 9.058 ft2 Ellipsoid Calculating the surface area of an ellipsoid does not have a simple, exact formula such as a cube or other simpler shape does. The calculator above uses an approximate formula that assumes a nearly spherical ellipsoid: SA \u2248 4\u03c0 1.6\u221a(a1.6b1.6 + a1.6c1.6 + b1.6c1.6)/3 where a, b, and c are the axes of the ellipse Coltaine has always enjoyed cooking and recently won a ceramic knife from a contest. Unfortunately for his family, who almost exclusively eat meat, Coltaine has been practicing his cutting technique on an excessive amount of vegetables. Rather than eating his vegetables, Coltaine's father stares dejectedly at his plate, and estimates the surface area of the elliptical cuts of zucchini with axes 0.1, 0.2, and 0.35 inches: SA \u2248 4\u03c0 1.6\u221a(0.11.60.21.6 + 0.11.60.351.6 + 0.21.60.351.6)/3 = 0.562 in2 Square Pyramid The surface area of a square pyramid is comprised of the area of its square base and the area of each of its four triangular faces. Given height h and edge length a, the surface area can be calculated using the following equations: base SA = a2 lateral SA = 2a\u221a(a/2)2 + h2 total SA = a2 + 2a\u221a((a/2)2 + h2) Vonquayla's classroom recently completed building a model of the Great Pyramid of Giza. However, she feels that the model does not exude the feeling of architectural wonder that the original does and decides that coating it with \"snow\" would at least impart an aspect of wonder. She calculates the surface area of melted sugar she would need to fully coat the pyramid with edge length a of 3 feet and height h of 5 feet: total SA = 32 + 2 \u00d7 3\u221a((3/2)^2 + 5^2) = 40.321 ft2 Unlike the Great Pyramid of Giza that has stood for thousands of years, its model, made of graham crackers and coated in sugar, lasted only a matter of days.

The main materialization concept is that in a specific light setting of inverted color process you can build an object in combustion sequence and if it fully composes it will solidify, if it doesn't the blue light transitions to regular color and nothing is there so its basically just a light process in a dark and light atmosphere but dark so you can blue orange light. That's why the materialization photo booth has dark sun glasses fully dark tinting.

Here's one possible interpretation: Let's say you have a value x, and you want to show that x < 15,000 is equivalent to 0.2 times a certain value. One way to approach this is to set up an equation: x = 0.2y To find the value of y that corresponds to x < 15,000, you can divide both sides of the inequality by 0.2:jiu\u00ffm x / 0.2 < 15,000 / 0.2 This simplifies to: x / 0.2 < 75,000 So, if x is less than 15,000, it's equivalent to 0.2 times a value less than 75,000.

For droid projection units to project International Space Station habitats. Written 2022: \u201cGenerally the basic concept of completing my method for the transmission of \"wireless\" electric charge is this: First you must establish a magnetic parameter. the proper way being as follows: for the first part of the parameter two magnets must be pushed together at negative ends. This can be duplicated as many times as needed (meaning that, in either a horizontal or vertical line, the process of negative magnet pushed against negative magnet can be repeated, stacking the process). Example: in a vertical line, two negative magnets are placed pushing against one another. Below this and above this the same process is repeated, making a horizontal, three line row of the same vertical process. To complete the magnetic parameter we must now establish the second portion: to enclose the parameter, we must now place a positive and a negative magnet directly next to the top and bottom magnets of the three row line of the magnets we just established. In this, we now create a horizontal magnetic pull between a positive and negative magnet, and we do this repeatedly until the formation of the parameter is complete. However, instead of repeating it identically, the process will be flipped for each repetition of the positive and negative magnetic connection so that the pull of the magnetism is being established both horizontally and vertically, with the magnets pulling against one another from top to bottom, and side by side. An extension of the example above: if there are three rows of negative magnets set up in a horizontal line on the right hand side, with their negative counterparts pushing against them vertically, on the left hand side of the top left magnet, we now place a positive magnet. Directly next to the right of the bottom left magnet we will place a negative magnet pulling at the positive magnet above it. This process needs to now be repeated until the parameter is complete. So we place a negative magnet to the right of the positive magnet at the top of the parameter, with a positive magnet placed to the right of the negative magnet at the bottom of the parameter, also pulling at the one above it. As stated above, the process of positive and negative magnetism is being flipped so that the pull of magnetism is not only running horizontally, but vertically as well. This entire process can be manipulated, with as few or as many magnets as needed, with each part of the process being completed either horizontally or vertically, in either a square or triangle shape. The magnets used can be of any size and any power, depending on preference. (You may also establish a magnetic parameter with positive and negative magnet being alternated until a circle is made, in any number, however, this type of parameter offers less structure) At the center of the magnetic parameter a material which is capable of conducting electricity, preferably, metal, needs to be established so that we can place the energy that we are collecting from the air into an electric current. As the electricity begins to flow into the metal at the center of the parameter, the electricity being accumulated should now be pulled by magnetism and placed into magnetic alternation. This is done to quickly increase the electric charge, so that the current is powerful enough to be utilized practically. Then, after the electric charge is powerful enough for use, it can then be pulled from the alternation (either gradually or intermittently), and directed into utilization. The parameter and alternation is one complete process. It is not separate, even if the method is separated by material and methods of wiring. This process can be modified for use in small objects, or it can be made as strong as needed for uses in items such as home generators, or electric cars. This process alone can be controlled in several ways. The most practical way is to balance the metal (or similar material) at the center of the parameter, and pull it out of the magnetic parameter whenever needed with the most practical method used for doing such, based on the device using the electric system. This can be done in a variety and a multitude of ways, hands free or hands on. Any method for doing such is not to be considered a modification or a variation of this process. It doesn't technically need to be removed if conducted correctly though. The monitoring and control of this electricity method can be done in a variety of ways also. Using sensors (with one type explained below) and systems which combine for self control of this electricity method. Making the complete process of wireless self charging electricity completely hands free and self controlled, without any need for buttons or switches used by hand. Another, more hands on approach to turning off or shutting down the electric flow is to separate the magnetic parameter, in any variation. Another possibility is the idea of a self controlling sensor, not one that removes the metal from the parameter, or one that senses the movement of the device using the method, but one which works on the opposite end of the entire process, after the alteration occurs. Using either a button, light, pressure, or oxygen to control the flow of electricity. This type of sensor would simply control the flow of the electricity transmitted to the object using the electricity. (Though, if the material at the center of the parameter is not being pulled from the parameter, there will need to be a method in place in which the electricity contained in the process (from the parameter to its utilization) will need to be removed, in whichever way, to avoid electrocution and any other improper or dangerous potential which electricity carries. Though most of this process can be covered with rubber for safety, the metal at the parameter will be exposed, meaning that there will need to be a practical method in place in the event that the metal comes in contact with water, though its potential for harm is extremely minimal. The idea of a self controlling sensor or any other variation for controlling the flow of electricity is a separate process from the method explained above for the ignition of electricity, though any combination to the control of the flow of electricity explained in the above process is not separate. This means that any other combination for the control of the electricity used in this process is not grounds for any newly patentable method, as those processes have already been explained and thoroughly connected to any variation of the method described above and which are covered completely in this patent and copyright. This is the meaning of the paragraph above: That though the ignition of electricity is one flowing process, from parameter to the direct utilization of electricity; the control of the electric flow in this process is also in its whole and complete, explained, patented, and copywritten idea. Though the idea may be used without any form of self control. Any form of control used with this method cannot be used as grounds for a new name or patent. There are two additional ideas which can be used in combination with the process above. Though the ideas can be explained and utilized individually, these ideas can also be considered a complete and fully explained function of the entire process. Meaning that even though they can be used outside of the process, and that though this method is capable of functioning without these processes, that together or separate they are all still one process under one patent, copyright, and inventor. One idea is called an \"atom/molecule biometric sensor\", and the other is called a \"humidity/temperature control process\". These processes are both additional steps to the original process. If they are used separately for any other purpose they're names cannot be changed, as they are still under one copyright and patent, owned and recognized by the same inventor. This means that though they are separate inventions, and their potential for utilization is separable, they are still patented and owned under one process. So, though they can be taken apart and used separately, they are still to be known under the names given in this complete explanation, and they are only to be utilized in the specifications written out in this document. This is the explanation for the \"atom/molecule biometric sensor\": This sensor functions as follows, its main operation relies on its programmed ability to recognize the atom or molecular structure of all variations of the particles in the air (and potentially all matter). As the atoms or molecules in the air contact the sensor, the sensor will rapidly read the measurements of the particles it comes in contact with and store new variations of these readings in its database, as the database builds the intelligence of the sensor improves. As the sensor rapidly measures, sorts, and identifies all of the particles in the air, it also calculates the mass amount of the particles contacting the sensor in a specific time frame. With the ability to identify the variations in the air particles, the sensor is capable of determining factors such as temperature, and whether the object using the sensor is falling or not. Also it will be intelligent when it comes to calculating variations in the surrounding weather conditions, making rapid decisions for other parts of the electricity system an easy task. As an example, if the electricity system described above were built into a smartphone, and that smartphone accidently fell out of the owners hands into water, this sensor would be capable of communicating the need to shut down and disburse the electricity left in the system so quickly that any potential for electrocution, or damage to the smartphone is fully avoided. Another example of its potential: a home generator is located outdoors using this electricity method, however a severe thunderstorm is brewing. This sensor would be capable of not only knowing when only an adjustment in the surrounding conditions of the parameter is needed, but it would also be capable of determining when to completely shut down the electricity transmission by the system alone, and rely on other built in methods to the generator, such as a backup battery to avoid any damage or electrocution. The sensor's ability to make these readings and determine the differentiations in the atoms and molecules in which it contacts will rely on its ability to recognize their breakdowns and structures based on a pre-programmed database. So for example, the exact shape, structure, and makeup of all of the basic atoms and molecules which fill the air will be known to this sensor's database. Meaning that its recognition is not based on any image or microscopic footage it's taking directly, which would be complicated and expensive, but rather by a measurement of the particle as it touches the glass above the sensor, this measurement is compared against those recognized in its database. Programming this type of recognition by computer would work as follows: a picture of an individual atom or molecule is taken as it contacts glass under a microscope. This image is then uploaded to a computer where it is measured on an x vs y grid. The calculations are made for its exact shape and structure and scaled to their real life size against glass, where its \"biometric fingerprint\" is now recognized. These pictures are takenand calculated in many variations of the glasses temperature, so that all of its variations are recognized in the memory of their touch. Furthermore, the color process of these pictures can be inverted and their color temperature can be calculated on the same grid. This is done to extend the accuracy in the exact calculation for determining factors in the varying conditions of the particles in the air. Potentially this can measure oxygen, humidity, precipitation, temperature, odors, or even hazardous materials in the air such as carbon monoxide, along with its intended use, and its data being used for research purposes of the earth. The explanation for the \"precipitation/ temperature control\" process is this: a thin metal (or similar material) sheet is established around the magnetic parameter. Then, established on the inside (or potentially the outside) of the metal (or similar material), a copper wire (or any other material used to conduct heat) will coil its inside (or outside). To pull the electricity through the wiring, a magnet can be placed at the end of the wire to pull the electric current (though direct current can be used similarly). For small objects, this process can be modified: a small sheet of metal or similar material can encompass the magnetic parameter established. on the metal sheet wrapping the parameter, a small piece of copper (or similar material which conducts heat through electricity), or several pieces of the copper, can be placed on the metal. The length and width of the metal sheet and the copper can vary based on the size of the system. It can also vary based on the level of the surrounding oxygen levels and the exact dimensions needed for controlling and manipulating this factor depending on the area in the world in which this method is being utilized. These dimensions and measurements will need to be experimented and tested in all weather conditions to properly know the correct measurements for the variation of the system. The copper wiring can either be set up to the original electricity method described above, or it can be established externally, apart from the transmission method described above. This electricity can be controlled, again with magnetism, or with other methods and sensors to heat the wire or pieces of material which conduct heat, upon command. This heat level can be monitored and tested so that the device using this electricity method knows exactly when to transmit the electricity to this part of the system in order to control the temperature and air around the magnetic parameter. As the coiled wiring (or copper pieces) will need to be heated intermittently, the exact timing of electricity transmitted will fluctuate based on the surrounding weather conditions. Meaning that this transmission will rely on other sensors put in place to monitor said conditions and these sensors will interact with and directly correlate with this part of this system (if used). Though the method explained above has the potential to complete this basic need, other methods can be used. This part of the process is exercised to control the air flowing into the magnetic parameter, not only for optimal function of this method but also for safety and control. As the exact conditions in the air constantly change, the sensor(s) used will need to fill two basic needs. It will need to determine the temperature of the area inside and outside of the parameter, and the differentiation of the conditions in the air (such as how much moisture, or precipitation the air contains). These levels are monitored merely so that the control and operation of the consistency and frequency in the electricity transmitted into the copper wiring or material conducting heat can sustain the desired condition in the air surrounding the parameter and its proper temperature. This process is necessary so that the air being used in the parameter is always measured as being exactly the same in both temperature and structure, on all measurable levels. This function is potentially desirable so that the system is never exposed to any fluctuations in the air flowing into the parameter. An optimal state of surrounding conditions in the air does exist, though its exact calculation is unknown to me currently. Methods of experimentation will need to be performed in order to find out these exact calculations for a preferred reading when it comes to the operations of this system. Technically this is not a necessary function for the operation of this system, and the method explained above can be completed without this step, though, it will optimize the potential in which the system functions. If this step is used, it is also to be considered one part of the process.\u201d My patenting method for this is as follows: Positive and negative magnets vertically positioned at pull to one another set against a horizontal row or rows of a or several negative magnet(s) at push point against one another with both magnetic push and pull in 1 magnetic parameter. at the center of the magnets are rotated at 4 copper metal (or titanium) silver gold rotated around the inside of the magnetic parameters, to be held in any shape.
